Russian roulette is a potentially lethal game of chance in which a player places a single round in a revolver, spins the cylinder, places the muzzle against the head or body, and pulls the trigger.

# Lore
You and Steve walk into a bar. A short chit chat, and he just won't stop blabbering how JavaScript is a misunderstood perfection. You try to lighten the mood with some React talk, you know he likes that, but today he doesn't stop. Today he's really getting on your nerves. "You know." - he said. - "I think C++ was a mistake. If only they had JS back then, world would have been a much better place". Alright. This is **it**. You pull out your trusty .50 Magnum that you use since 89. "If you're so sure, let's bet" - you say, loading a single bullet into the drum. Steve looks like someone meantioned crosscompilation, but doesn't back down. Time to play.
